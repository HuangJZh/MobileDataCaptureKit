# MobileDataCaptureKit

A lightweight Android application designed for researchers to capture **synchronized camera and sensor data** using a smartphone.  
This tool integrates the **Camera2 API** with multiple onboard sensors, making it ideal for research in **mobile sensing, computer vision, robotics, AR/VR, environment sensing**, and data-driven experiments.

##  Features

-  **Camera2 API Support**  
  Capture image frames or preview data using the Android Camera2 system.

-  **Multi-Sensor Data Collection**  
  Supports common smartphone sensors:
    - Accelerometer
    - Gyroscope
    - Magnetometer
    - Pressure sensor
    - (and easily extensible)

-  **Synchronized Data Streams**  
  Camera and sensor data are captured with timestamps to support time-aligned analysis.

-  **Lightweight & Easy to Modify**  
  A simple codebase designed to be forked, extended, and integrated into research workflows.

-  **Research-Oriented**  
  Useful for projects in mobile sensing, SLAM, activity recognition, sensor fusion, environment mapping, and more.
